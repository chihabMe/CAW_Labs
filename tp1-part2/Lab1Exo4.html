    <h1>Welcome to Exercise 4</h1>
    <h2>Short Text Section</h2>
    <p>This is a short paragraph with only a few sentences for demonstration purposes.</p>

    <h2>Long Text Section</h2>
    <p>
        This paragraph is much longer, intended to display the styles applied to long text. 
        It should include enough lines to illustrate how text behaves with indentation, 
        margins, and line height. You can modify this text as needed.
